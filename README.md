# Mahjong Object Pose Estimation

- We use the PPF to do the object recognition feature and hash table for 3D descriptor.
- By utilizing the [point cloud library](http://pointclouds.org/), we now only could run the program on Win7 visual studio 2010.
- we use PCL 1.7.0

## TODOS
- Run this program on Ubuntu 14.04
- Modified the **socket** for linux compatible 
- Modified the **kinect bringup** part for linux compatible
- Be careful about the function syntax of  the 3rd party version, like boost.
